Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) has the potential to revolutionize the area of quantum computing. QRAM uses quantum computing principles to store and modify quantum or classical data efficiently, greatly accelerating a wide range of computer processes. Despite its importance, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that cover the entire spectrum of QRAM architectures. We fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of QRAM, emphasizing its significance and viability in existing noisy quantum computers. By drawing comparisons with conventional RAM for ease of understanding, this survey clarifies the fundamental ideas and actions of QRAM.
