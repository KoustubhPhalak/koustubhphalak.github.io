Identification and verification of molecular properties such as side effects is one of the most important and time-consuming steps in the process of molecule synthesis. For example, failure to identify side effects before submission to regulatory groups can cost millions of dollars and months of additional research to the companies. Failure to identify side effects during the regulatory review can also cost lives. The complexity and expense of this task have made it a candidate for a machine learning-based solution. Prior approaches rely on complex model designs and excessive parameter counts for side effect predictions. We believe reliance on complex models only shifts the difficulty away from chemists rather than alleviating the issue. Implementing large models is also expensive without prior access to high-performance computers. We propose a heuristic approach that allows for the utilization of simple neural networks, specifically the recurrent neural network, with a 98+% reduction in the number of required parameters compared to available large language models while still obtaining near identical results as top-performing models.
