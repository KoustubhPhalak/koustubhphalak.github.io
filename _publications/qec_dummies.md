In the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, qubit technologies are prone to imperfections, giving rise to various errors such as gate errors, decoherence/dephasing, measurement errors, leakage, and crosstalk. These errors present challenges in achieving error-free computation within NISQ devices. A proposed solution to this issue is Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which aims to rectify the corrupted qubit state through a three-step process: (i) detection: identifying the presence of an error, (ii) decoding: pinpointing the location(s) of the affected qubit(s), and (iii) correction: restoring the faulty qubits to their original states. QEC is an expanding field of research that encompasses intricate concepts. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the historical context, current state, and future prospects of Quantum Error Correction, tailored to cater to computer scientists with limited familiarity with quantum physics and its associated mathematical concepts. In this work, we, (a) explain the foundational principles of QEC and explore existing Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECC) designed to correct errors in qubits, (b) explore the practicality of these QECCs concerning implementation and error correction quality, and (c) highlight the challenges associated with implementing QEC within the context of the current landscape of NISQ computers.
