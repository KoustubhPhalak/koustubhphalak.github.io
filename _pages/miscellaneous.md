1\. Yoga and Meditation
-----
Since 2016, I have been practicing Yoga and Meditation techniques for 7 years. First, I learned the basic course Youth Empowerment Skills Plus (YES+) followed by the advanced course Silent Retreat, both conducted by the Art of Living Foundation. I am grateful for their teachings, for Sudarshan Kriya (a powerful guided meditation technique) has always helped me tide the ups and downs of life 😄

2\. Swimming
-----
I really like swimming. Before my swimming classes, I used to hate them because of my fear of drowning. But after putting myself inside water and looking at the wonderful world underwater using swimming goggles, my hatred changed to affection 🏊😎
